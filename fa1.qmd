## Question 1

If patients from a single hospital clinic (seen by the same physician) are randomly assigned to one of two groups (treatment or control), how many *levels* of a model would you need to predict patient outcomes?

::: {.fragment}
- One level: similar to fit a *one-source* ANOVA model or a simple linear regression model.

- Why? Patients were randomly assigned to treatment or control group within a **single clinic**, so there should be no additional variation after accounting for the fixed effects of the groups.

## Question 2

What if the previous study were extended to 50 hospitals, in which 25 hospitals were treatment sites and 25 hospitals were control sites â€” then how many *levels* of a model would be needed to predict patient outcomes?

::: {.fragment}
- Two levels: patients (level 1) nested within hospitals (level 2).

- Treatment would be a level 2 predictor.

## Question 3

What is the common underlying feature of general linear models (e.g., regression, ANOVA, and ANCOVA) or generalized linear models (e.g., logistic, ordinal, count regression) that makes them insufficient for multilevel data?

::: {.fragment}
- They assume independence of observations, which is violated in hierarchical data where observations are nested within higher-level units (e.g., patients within hospitals), leading to correlated residuals, biased standard errors, and *smushed* fixed effects.

## Question 4 {.nonincremental .scrollable}

How is **ICC1** computed? What are three interpretations of ICC1?

::: {.fragment}
- ICC1 is computed as the proportion of total outcome variance that is attributable to differences between clusters:

$$\frac{\tau_{U_0}^2}{\tau_{U_0}^2 + \sigma_e^2}$$

where $\tau_{U_0}^2$ is the between-cluster variance and $\sigma_e^2$ is the within-cluster variance.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Three interpretations of ICC1:
:::

::: {.fragment}
  1. Proportion of total variance that is between clusters.
  2. Average correlation of persons from same cluster.
  3. Effect size for constant cluster dependency.
:::

## Question 5 {.scrollable}

How does **ICC2** differ from ICC1? What is an important caveat in thinking about ICC2 as a measure of reliability?

::: {.fragment}
- ICC2 is computed similarly to ICC1 but focuses on the reliability of the cluster means:

$$ICC2 = \frac{\tau_{U_0}^2}{\tau_{U_0}^2 + (\sigma_e^2/L1n)}$$

where $L1n$ is the number of individuals per cluster (the other terms are the same as in ICC1).
:::

::: {.fragment}
- An important caveat is *how much* variation in the outcome is attributable to between-cluster mean differences.
